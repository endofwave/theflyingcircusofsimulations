# The Flying Circus of Simulations - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
An interactive website presenting solutions to problems from "The Flying Circus of Physics" through markdown explanations and React-based physics simulations.

## Current State
- Basic Next.js project setup completed
- Initial page structure with dummy content (page.tsx)
- First problem implementation started:
  - chalk-squeal.md (explanation)
  - chalk-react-simulation.tsx (interactive simulation)
- Project location: E:\Projects\theflyingcircusofsimulations

## Completed Steps
1. Initial Next.js project creation
2. Basic project structure setup
3. Implementation of first problem (chalk squealing) started
4. Installation of required development tools:
   - Git
   - GitHub Desktop
5. Project documentation initialized

## Key Decisions
1. Technology Stack:
   - Next.js for the framework
   - React for interactive simulations
   - Markdown for problem explanations
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
2. Project Structure:
   - Markdown files for explanations
   - React components for simulations
   - Minimal starter template from Vercel

## Next Steps
1. GitHub Repository Setup:
   - Create new repository
   - Initial commit
   - Push existing code
2. Vercel Deployment:
   - Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
   - Configure deployment settings
   - First deployment
3. Project Structure Enhancement:
   - Setup proper routing
   - Create components directory
   - Implement layout structure

## Current Activity
- Preparing for initial GitHub repository setup and Vercel deployment

## Outstanding Questions
1. Will we need additional dependencies for physics simulations?
2. Should we implement a search functionality for problems?
3. How will we handle mobile responsiveness for simulations?

## Notes
- Keep documentation updated with each significant change
- Track all major decisions and their rationales
- Document any issues encountered and their solutions
- Document deployment process and configuration
